# University Reports Repository

This repository contains a collection of reports I completed during my university studies.

## Projects

### 1. **DNS Domain Type Detection Using Topic Modeling**
   - **Description**: Developed a model to detect malicious DNS domain types in unlabeled data using topic modeling techniques.

### 2. **Road Condition Monitoring Software - Project Management**
   - **Description**: Managed a team of seven people in a project focused on developing road condition monitoring software in Denmark. The project implemented agile methodologies to streamline development and ensure efficient collaboration.

### 3. **Deep Learning Model for Solar Irradiance and Energy Production Forecasting**
   - **Description**: Collaborated with a research laboratory at EPFL to develop a deep learning model for forecasting solar irradiance and energy production. The model leveraged real-time image data from publicly accessible cameras.
